# Clean Shopper — Claude Code Instructions

## Project
Clean Shopper is a personal product research assistant for ingredient-aware consumers. Users search for home and personal care products, get AI-generated clean/not-clean assessments based on ingredient safety data, save products to a personal library organized by category, and build shopping lists.

Single-user app. No authentication in V1. Local state plus Supabase for data persistence.

## Tech Stack
- React (Vite) -- frontend UI
- Supabase -- database and data layer (PostgreSQL)
- Claude API (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) -- AI product research and ingredient analysis
- EWG Skin Deep API -- ingredient safety data
- Vercel -- deployment
- Tailwind CSS -- styling

## Conventions
- Components: PascalCase filenames, one component per file
- File placement: shared components reused across multiple screens belong in /src/components/. Files specific to a single screen belong in that screen's folder under /src/features/ (e.g. /src/features/browse/). Do not mix the two — a component that only one screen uses should not be in /src/components/, and a shared component should not live inside a feature folder.
- Components: Always check /docs/component-spec.md before building any UI element. If an existing component covers the use case, use it. Only create a new component if no spec covers the pattern, and add the new component to component-spec.md before moving on.
- Utility functions: camelCase, lives in /src/lib/
- API calls: all external API calls through /src/lib/api/, never inline in components
- Styling: Tailwind only. No inline styles. No CSS modules.
- Styling: Use Tailwind theme classes for all design token values. Never hardcode hex colors, pixel font sizes, or spacing values in components. If a needed token does not exist in the Tailwind config, add it there rather than hardcoding the value. This means bg-primary not #2D7B5E, text-h3 not text-lg, p-lg not p-4.
- State: React useState and useContext only. No Redux, no Zustand.
- File naming: kebab-case for all non-component files
- Markup: use semantic HTML elements

## Do Not
- Do not add user authentication or account features -- V1 is single-user only
- Do not use CSS other than Tailwind
- Do not add features outside the current build phase without asking first
- Do not create new components when an existing component in the component library covers the use case
- Do not use any AI model other than claude-sonnet-4-20250514

- Design system: See /docs/design-system.md — follow these visual specifications for all UI work. Do not hardcode colors, font sizes, spacing, or shadows.
- Tailwind config: See tailwind.config.js for design tokens as Tailwind theme extensions. Always use theme classes, never hardcode values.
